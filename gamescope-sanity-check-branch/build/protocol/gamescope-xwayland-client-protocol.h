 * Xwayland creates a wl_surface for each X11 window. It sends a
 * WL_SURFACE_ID client message to indicate the mapping between the X11
 * windows and the wl_surface objects.
 *
 * This request overrides this mapping for a given X11 window, allowing an
 * X11 client to submit buffers via the Wayland protocol. The override
 * only affects buffer submission. Everything else (e.g. input events)
 * still uses Xwayland's WL_SURFACE_ID.
 *
 * x11_server is gotten by the GAMESCOPE_XWAYLAND_SERVER_ID property on the
 * root window of the associated server.
